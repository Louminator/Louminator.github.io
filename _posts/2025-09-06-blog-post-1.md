What to do when you finish your term as dean
======

A little less than a week ago, I finished my 5 year term as the
inaugural dean of the University of Delaware Graduate College and
began a long postponed sabbatical. Serving as dean was a very
consuming role. When I was done, I quietly took to the sea for a few days with my
brother and son aboard my 32 foot sloop.

To those who know me, there
is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, all
people in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the
same feelings towards the seas with me.*
