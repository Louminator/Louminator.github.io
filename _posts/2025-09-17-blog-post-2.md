It's time to rebuild my website.


Rebuilding my website.
======

It is time to replace my old website because it's been many years since I've had time to work at it!

It's replacing an old site that my son created using Bootstrap many
years ago. I liked it, but it's a bear to maintain, so I didn't do much to it.  This
time, I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static HTML generator, and the
[Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io) template. It integrates with Github Pages, so everything is under version control.
I'm starting with the basics, and I have found that adding things is easy.
