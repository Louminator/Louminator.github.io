It's time to rebuild my website.


Rebuilding my website.
======

A little over two weeks ago, I finished my 5 year term as the
inaugural dean of the University of Delaware Graduate College and
began a long postponed sabbatical.

It's replacing an old site that my son created using Bootstrap many
years ago. I liked it, but it's a bear to maintain, so I didn't.  This
time, I am using Jekyll, a static HTML generator, and the
Academic Pages template.
