I am a mathematician, an educator and often a leader at the University of
Delaware. I see mathematics in everything around me. One of the
great things about a career as a university faculty member is that you
have the opportunity and freedom to play many roles working with many
talented faculty, staff and students. As a scholar and educator, I
enjoy helping students learn about and discover mathematics at all
levels. I enjoy teaching at all levels. Some of my most advanced students have gone on to be faculty
elsewhere while others have gone into industry.  As a department
chair, I enjoyed advancing our department's mission and supporting the
faculty in achieving their goals and aspirations. As the inaugural dean of
the Graduate College, I led the creation of our Graduate College, a
college that worked across the entire university to promote excellence
in graduate preparation and research.

Research and students
======


My research interests focus on numerical methods and analysis of a
variety of problems. I seek new and exciting mathematical problems
that arise in the world around us. Much of this work involves moving
particles of one kind or another, partial differential equations or
computational methods. My research has been applied to fluid flows,
insect swarms, wired and wireless networks, and robotics. Most
research at R1 institutions is done by students working side-by-side
with faculty mentors. So, most of these mathematical advances are stories of
discovery of knowledge but they are also stories of growth and
development of my students.
