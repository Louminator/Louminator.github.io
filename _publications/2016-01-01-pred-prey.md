Predator-prey systems in plankton are a long-standing interest of
mine. My colleague, marine scientist Kathy Coyne, introduced me to
them. There is so much going on with these critters. Everyone thinks
of predator-prey systems as well-mixed ecologies without much
attention going to the interactions. Imagine blind predators racing
about trying to capture blind prey! I brought this problem to a
graduate student mathematical modeling summer camp where students
spend a week building and analyzing mathematical models. Two of the
students were so excited that together we pushed the model through to
a publishable result complete with a phase diagram that explains just
about everything and simulations of more complex systems.
